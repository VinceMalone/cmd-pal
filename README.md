# Prompts

- text
- single-choice
- multi-choice
- confirm

## Future

- number
- password

# TODO

- "message"
- empty list UI
- API for _styling_
- focus-trap
- explore _nested prompts_ again

# Open Questions

- how far can/should I go for having compound components?
- how shitty is the `pipe` prop?
- what's the semantic and API difference between a "choice list" and a "command list"?
